\section{The UniRep model}

\subsection{Motivation}

Unsupervised learning

Lots of unlabelled protein data

Representation learning

Automatic feature extraction

\subsection{Main contribution}

Protein feature predictions

Universal protein feature extraction model

Enabling protein engineering prediction task

\subsection{Discussion and results}

The unirep models (64, 256, 1900)

Unirep fusion - where is it better

Question: Average of hidden states... Why?

\section{Reproduction of UniRep}

\subsection{Evaluation}

\section*{UniRep}
The UniRep model \cite{alley2019unified} enables stability prediction of proteins, and so one claim is that this allows for the UniRep model by work as a basis for the prediction of protein function directly from protein sequence (ref).
